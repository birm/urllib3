Contributing
============

urllib3 is a community-maintained project and we happily accept contributions.

If you wish to add a new feature or fix a bug:

#. `Check for open issues <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/issues>`_ or open
   a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug. There is
   a *Contributor Friendly* tag for issues that should be ideal for people who
   are not very familiar with the codebase yet.
#. Fork the `urllib3 repository on Github <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_
   to start making your changes.
#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works
   as expected.
#. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published.
   :) Make sure to add yourself to ``CONTRIBUTORS.txt``.


Sponsorship

Please consider sponsoring urllib3 development, especially if your company
benefits from this library.

Project Grant
-------------

A grant for contiguous full-time development has the biggest impact for
progress. Periods of 3 to 10 days allow a contributor to tackle substantial
complex issues which are otherwise left to linger until somebody can't afford
to not fix them.

Contact `@shazow <https://github.com/shazow>`_ to arrange a grant for a core
contributor.

Huge thanks to all the companies and individuals who financially contributed to
the development of urllib3. Please send a PR if you've donated and would like
